## Logic Problem Day! The children's game of "FizzBuzz"

Today we took a break from revisiting course work. It's a relax day to recover from this week's quiz!
<br>
We take a crack at a very common coding interview question - implementing the game of FizzBuzz.

<hr>

What is FizzBuzz?<br>
•	Played by two people counting up in turn.<br>
•	Every time there is a Multiple of 3 you say “Fizz”<br>
•	Every time there is a Multiple of 5 you say “Buzz”<br>
•	Every time there is a Multiple of BOTH you say “FizzBuzz”<br>

The logic problem<br>
•	Create a program that plays FizzBuzz for the numbers 1 through 100

<hr>

The code uploaded to this repository would be considered "Best Practice" because no single line of code is repeated, and it is easily maintainable. We demonstrate this by adding more rules, such as saying "Foo" every time there is a multiple of 7.

As always, if you have any question please send me an email at thomas.lauer@mnsu.edu.

Have a great weekend, and I will see you on Tuesday!
